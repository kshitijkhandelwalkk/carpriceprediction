# Car Price Prediction System

There are so many variables that influence a used car's pricing on the market, it can be difficult
to determine whether the quoted price is accurate. This project's main goal is to create machine
learning models that can effectively estimate a used car's price based on its attributes, enabling
them to make well- informed decisions.
-We use and assess learning methodologies on a dataset comprising the selling prices of
various models and manufacturers.

###### 1.Various factors will be taken into consideration while determining the car's pricing.Regression The reason algorithms are utilized is that their output is a continuous valuerather than a categorized value, which makes it easy to estimate the true cost of an automobile rather than just the range of prices.
###### 2. The market for old cars is expanding rapidly; in the previous several years, its market value has nearly doubled.
###### 3. The rise of internet portals like CarDheko, Quicker, Carwale, Cars24, and numerous others has made it easier for buyers and sellers to learn more about the patterns and trends that influence a used car's market value.

### The variables that are used are as follows:
######
 Cost: The GM vehicles computed retail cost.
###### Mileage: The total kilometers driven by the vehicle driven.
###### Model: The model for each automobile.
###### Fuel: The kind of fuel the car runs on, such as petrol or diesel.
###### Year: The year the actual owner of the car purchased it.
